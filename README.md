# Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) Prediction Website using Deep Learning

This project is a web application for predicting the probability of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) using clinical and biochemical data inputs. The prediction model is based on a deep learning algorithm.

## Features

- Input clinical history data such as Adverse Pregnancy, Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy, and more.
- Input biochemical data such as Alanine Aminotransferase, Aspartate Aminotransferase, and more.
- Predict the probability of GDM using a deep learning model.
- Simple and intuitive user interface with a pastel theme and lavender background.

### Clinical History Data
- Adverse Pregnancy (AP)
- Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy (ICP)
- Thyroid Diseases (TD)
- Eclampsia
- Twins
